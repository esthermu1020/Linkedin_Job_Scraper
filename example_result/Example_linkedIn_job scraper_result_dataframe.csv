This role requires strong familiarity with Malaysia’s financial regulatory environment, particularly Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) requirements and frameworks relevant to Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), Consumer Protection, Shariah Compliance, and Credit Risk.

Minimum Requirements • Bachelor’s degree or equivalent, preferably in Law, Finance, Business, or a related field. • Minimum of 10 years of experience in regulatory compliance within financial services, ideally with a fintech, digital lender, BNM or CCOB TF. • Strong technical understanding of the Malaysian financial regulatory landscape, including BNM guidelines and licensing requirements. • Familiarity with CCOB requirements and Malaysia’s evolving Consumer Credit Act landscape. • Proven track record of managing regulatory engagements and developing compliance programs for a regulated entity. • Strong analytical and communication skills, with the ability to translate complex regulations into practical business actions. • Excellent stakeholder management skills, with the ability to work cross-functionally across business, operations, legal, and strategy teams. • Self-starter who takes initiative to drive complex compliance projects from start to finish. • Articulate in both written and verbal communication, with a strong command of policy drafting and regulatory correspondence. • Prior experience managing team members will be a strong plus, but not required. Regardless, the successful candidate must demonstrate a strong mindset and commitment to developing talent within the team. This includes providing guidance, building capabilities, and creating an environment for high performance. Team leadership and people development will be a key part of how success is measured in this role.
